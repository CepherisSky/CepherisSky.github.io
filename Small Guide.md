# A small guide to web hosting services and resources

This compilation of mostly connected web hosting related mini-guides and essays was made as an example for the Othercon 2025 panel “Under The HoodTM \#Therian Mutual Aid”

# Web Hosting

With the importance of the web in today’s society, it’s not surprising there’s a lot of web hosting options out there.  I’ve compiled here a small, but by no means exhaustive, list of some of the services I’ve seen recommended around alterhuman spaces.

### [Neocities](https://neocities.org/)

Neocities is the most common one I’ve seen around, and it’s not surprising given the features it offers for free.  Its user dashboard and integrated webring-like features make it a pretty good fit for private sites made for a small community.

### [Nekoweb](https://nekoweb.org/)

I have not personally used Nekoweb, but to my understanding it is quite similar to Neocities, just with a different skin and different user dashboard that might make it easier or more appealing to some people.  It also includes the ability to invite others to work on your site with you, which makes it good for collaborative projects.

### [Teacake](https://teacake.org/) & [Leprd](https://leprd.space/)

Both of these are small independent web hosting sites which are able to offer a fair bit more storage than many of the other free hosting services due to their limited sign-up policies.  Neither are currently accepting new sites right now, but they might be worth watching if you want something free with a little more space.

### [Github](https://github.com/)

I’ve seen Github mentioned a couple times, usually with the caveat that it’s fairly robust and capable with its many supported file types and collaborator and version control capabilities, but also pretty intimidating and difficult for new users.  After learning it in my research for this panel… That is completely true.  However, that difficulty mostly seems to come from its complicated and feature rich user interface, so if you’re willing to take a moment and learn which buttons do what, it's not actually that bad.

# You have a website\!...  Now what?

The default for most web hosting services is to immediately give you full control of everything and all the actual programming is left up to you.  This can, for some people (like me), be extremely intimidating and overwhelming and can quickly leave people with already limited spoons completely out of energy, especially if you have to learn two entire new languages to even get started.  
The good news is you don’t have to do this alone.  You can use the tools and stepping stones left behind by all the people before you to make things much easier and faster.  
This leads me to the first of the main resources I want to touch on:

### Static Site Generators

Static Site Generators (or SSGs for short) are tools that allow you to write the content you want hosted in one format (such as markdown) and they’ll automatically generate and upload the proper files to put that information onto your website.  They’re kinda like a translator, but for website file types.  And, between all the different file types and desired functionalities, a *lot* of different kinds exist.  Some of them work as apps you can download and use like a notes app, but every note is hosted on your blog.  Others work between your browser and computer’s command line allowing you to immediately see how a potential change will affect your site before you officially upload the change.  And still others are basically just a fancy file of free-to-use code on the user end that you can copy into your HTML file to let it read all files of one kind as another kind.  
And that brings me to the second resource

### Free to use code

With how long the internet has been around a lot of code has been written and guides made.  And a lot of kind strangers on the internet have made free-to-use resources and code templates that can be used for new websites.  If you’re like me you might have avoided using those templates because you wanted your site to be completely unique and Custom CodedTM.  But just like a free art base these resources were made to be used.  Use them.  You can cut down on a lot of the initial coding requirements and make the workload a lot more manageable if you do.  Use a website theme generator to make some code you can copy into your CSS file to make your website pretty, use a JS template to make a light mode/dark mode switcher, use the free HTML someone’s Website Beginner’s Guide to get your website off the ground and functional first.  You can’t share something that doesn’t exist, make it exist first.  The customization can come later.

### Your nerd friends are people, but they can be resources too

A lot of us probably know someone who we see as very capable at programming, and they can be resources too.  Ask them for their favorite resources, bounce ideas off of them when you’re brainstorming, ask for help if you run into a problem, possibly consider formally commissioning them for setup help if you have the means and the project scope is beyond them.  And be sure to thank them for their time, web and software development is a pretty valuable skill and if you’re getting free live tutorials that’s definitely worth at least a bit of thanks.

# Multi person projects and version control

Have you ever wanted to create a wiki-like resource where anyone with an account can edit things?  Or a site that a whole writing group can independently access to host their writing on a particular topic?  Did you know that you can just do that, and it’s not even that hard?  You could always just make an account with a shared login, yes, but a lot of web hosting sites innately allow collaborative work.  Github, for example, lets you allow people access to your repository to give them the ability to make edits.  And if your repository is public they can still contribute even if you don’t allow them direct access by making their own copy (called a fork) and you can merge their changes back into your master copy when you want to.  Github also makes it really easy to manage other peoples changes with version control.  Version control lets you not only see who made what change when, but also lets you revert changes if someone accidentally breaks something.  
On a similar vein to that thought

### Back it up.  Save it.  Don’t lose it

I can not stress enough how important backups and duplicate copies of things are.  Nothing on the internet is truly permanent, Servers crash, Files corrupt, Websites die, don’t let the cool things you’ve made get lost with them.  Make digital copies of your writing and art on your computer, or a portable drive and print extra copies to save physically.  Future you and will thank you.

### Finally, don’t let not having a website stop you from creating

You don’t have to have a website to start writing, you can just write, no one is going to stop you (we’ll probably thank you, actually).  
For a long time I looked at the comprehensive essays written by some of the big name alterhumans and wished I could make things like that, and it didn’t occur to me that I just can.  Write things in your favorite text editor or notes app.  Make long posts on your favorite social media.  Write and draw and talk about things.  Just because you don’t have your own website doesn’t mean you can’t make cool things.
